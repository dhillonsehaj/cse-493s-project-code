I miss him. I miss my first boyfriend. He did very terrible things to me in the end and literally messed up my emotions. It's been like 3 months and I haven't thought about him anymore until a week ago. He's starting to haunt me more and more. Please help...,"As that was your first ever boyfriend, I understand you missing him. If I ever get a first girlfriend, I would miss her too. However, this guy did terrible things to you. There are other guys out there who will love you and treat you with respect. Good luck","This seems to include some interpretation since it refers to the abuse and first boyfriend, but did not go much more in depth. It is possible the model is looking for more robust interpretation like more recollection or similar experiences shared based on the seeker post."
I don't know anymore. I feel so empty that this is all I can explain,That's a familiar feeling. Talk it out. What's up?,"This is a very very weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
I don't want to be alone.. But I have to be.,How tragic and true. We of r/depression can be alone together.,"This is a very very weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
"You used to be that guy that everyone like and now, you just seem broken. What's wrong?. Do I? Oh, I didn't really see it. Thanks for showing your concern but I'm fine.","Funny how pharases like that say everything you know, give an answer why you are depressed and then ask you why are depressed.","This is a somewhat weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
Do you ever just know in the morning that today is going to be a really shitty day..and then you were right?. I'm always right about it. So when I feel that way I loose all hope and give up for that day,"Don't tell yourself that's it's going to be a shitty day. Literally force a smile, beat the thoughts in your head into submission. I read once that people who have terrible sleep can lessen the affects of tiredness by telling themselves they had a good sleep, actually vocally saying to yourself I had a great sleep, and it works. It may not completely erase your sleepy eyes, but it's better than being drowsy all day because you keep dwelling on the shit sleep you had the night before. Placebo.","The only interpretation here is the 'shitty day' which is somewhat weak which explains why the model failed to predict it."
"I'm gonna smoke my last hit of weed, try to feel happy, probably cry. I have $14 in my bank account",That's terrible. I can understand the struggle they must be. This world is not sustainable for a lot of people.,"This is a very very weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
"Mom: Are you okay? You look sad. Me: Yeah. I'm fine... _I suppose I'm fucking fine if I sit against a door with my legs folded, arms on knees and head buried in arms._ She walked away, not saying a word. I wasn't looking at her. I wasn't even feeling insecure. _I feel like an idiot. Why do I have to be such a coward.._",Because saying yeah I'm fine takes less effort than explaining how you really feel.,"This is a very very weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
Lonely. I don't want to be alone but I don't have anyone to reach out to,"Hey, I know how frustrating it feels when you have no one to reach out to.I am here for you if you want to talk, friend.","This is a weak interpretation but the post is very short so the modely may not be able to predict it as any interpretation since there may not be as much comparably to others."
"I dropped out. One semester short of a bachelors in math. Ended a year long relationship. Quit my job. not sorry for leaving, sorry I stayed so long.",I like your conviction. Sometimes cleaning the slate is what you need. What's next in the life master plan?,"This is a very very weak interpretation which is likely why the model failed to predict it."
"Why does everyone i see seem so perfect. Why everyone seems so perfect and I am no where near perfection, I know that perfection doesn't exist but it's so unreal how perfect people look and I don't look any perfect. Anyone can relate ?","I can relate to some degree. You've got it right though, perfection does not exist. There are people with it better and people with it worse. It's a very destructive thing to think about yourself negatively. Try thinking about the things you do well for a change.","This response highlights relating to the seeker but does not relate back to or share similar experiences to that of the seeker which makes the interpretation weak but the model may not pick up on the subtlety."
