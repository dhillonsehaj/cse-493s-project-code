"How does it feel like to be drunk?. I'm underage, haven't been drunk all my life. However, with everything going on with my mind right now, I kind of want to be drunk right now.","an enhancer of mood. The danger of drinking goes like this: Alcohol makes you numb. While also making your focus more on certain things. So, if you are angry and you drink, you might start to feel less angry. This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side. In other words, the more you drink, the close you move to passing out...which explains why you feel less the more you drink. This seems like not the worst thing in the word. But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling. This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it. But when you do find yourself drinking one day, try to think about why your drinking. Whenever I have drank because I was sad or angry, I had a miserable time. Whenever I drank because I was around good company and wanted to relax a bit, it was fun. Responsibility is truly key to the concept of alcohol.","This seeker post is more of a question and includes a bit about the seekers condition. The response starts out with a lot of information and ends with some interpretation. This large bit of text answering the question could possibly have overrun the models prediction and resulted in a no interpretation prediction."
"Living feels like hell. I want to die. I want to stop hurting. It hurts more that I go through with it. I have any reason to be sad, either.",I wish I had a reason to accommodate this suffering,"Not sure why this pair is strong interpretation, it is not very visible here."
someone please help me. Im scared of i dont know,lol same but how can you help that,"Short response, not much to interpret, just responds with saying 'same' which is not very strong."
"My dog has cancer. She has cancer in her nose, and over the next few months im going to watch my childhood friend struggle to breathe more and more until the end. Is this all my life is going to be, just watching things I love suffer and die? Whats the fucking point.","I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help. *-hugs-*","This is quite a strong interpretation. Honestly not sure why the model predicted this one wrong. Could be because it uses a lot of third person language."
"Do people know I'm depressed?. I'm 26 and very depressed. I work at an office with people my age or older, and I often wonder if they know I'm depressed. Do they only think I'm quiet and don't laugh much? I think it's pretty obvious that I'm not okay, but no one has ever asked.","People lie to themselves on a subconscious level and insist you're just quiet and doing ok, because they don't have the courage to deal with it if you weren't.","This is a subtle interpreation. The response responds to the content but does not explicitly communicate understanding through speculation or reflection which could lead to the 0 prediction."
"Writing it out. I tried to write my feelings down on a piece of paper but it stayed blank. And somehow, it have been any more accurate.","Spend some time just to meditate and clear out your mind. Take a walk around town. Maybe go buy a coffee, something to distract yourself before you attempt the 'writing assignment'. Just start simple. It doesn't have to be in paragraph form or even complete sentences. Maybe bullet points will make it easier.","This is a subtle interpreation. The response responds to the content but does not explicitly communicate understanding through speculation or reflection which could lead to the 0 prediction."
What is happiness?. always found it difficult to be happy. What makes you happy? What made you realise it was the thing that made you happy?,"true happiness is, for me, is acceptance of how sad the world is and knowing that you're truly making it better for the people in your reach. Making it better for your loved ones and friends and that includes yourself. Don't think i could ever be 100% happy, that's just being naive.","This response reflects back on the responders experiences, but the post overall does not seem to provoke much into the seekers experience but mostly a general question which the model may not understand as being related to the seeker specifically to be interpreted."
"I have come to terms with the fact that I am unlovable. Just because I've accepted it doesn't make it hurt any less. I wish I want disabled, I wish I wasn't ugly, I wish I was at least average height, I wish I was confident. That, or I wish I was dead. I can't handle being this lonely any longer.","I have that feeling too... but then I read it can be one of the symptoms of PTSD, so I really don't know what to think about it","This is a short response which just states a shared feeling and some additional information, which makes sense why the model failed to predict accurately."
Is it possible to get out of my own head?. That seems to ultimately be my biggest issue. I sabotage myself in everything I do. How do I get out of my own head?? Is it even possible or is this just what I'm going to have to cope with from now on?,Try CBT. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Find a therapist who uses this method. I've just started this so I can't personally verify that it will work but it has worked for others.,"This is a short response which just states a shared experience and some additional information, which makes sense why the model failed to predict accurately."
"I have absolutely nothing original to contribute to or real life. I'm good at stringing meaningless, unoriginal words together sometimes on Not really talent show material",I would like to partake in the talent show Wait No I wouldn't.,"This is a short response which doesn't share much interpretation. Not sure why it is annotated this way."
