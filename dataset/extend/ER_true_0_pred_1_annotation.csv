The rare moments I leave my depression are worse. I only realize how far I've fallen behind.. Depression is better than anxiety for me.,"You realize what s wrong. There's many things wrong and even though you're depressed you are comfortable in some way. Because realizing you must change your ways, can put some one in a discomfort zone. Truth is, you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness. An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass. There's no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way.","This response may be marked as weak empathy because the model may be perceiving the annecdote as a pattern of similar behavior the responder has to the seeker. The annotaters mark weak empathy when the responder shares similar feelings, and this response includes an annecdote of what someone may be feeling, so the model may learn this sort of patter from general annecdotes."
Guys it really hurts. I just want it to stop,"Can you open-up a bit to explain? What's the matter? Go on, if it's alright with you.","This response seems to share concern from the responder. It's interesting the annotater did not consider the 'What's the matter' as a concerned responder."
"Iâ€™ve been sober for about a month, but I just went to the store to buy more beer.. I bought toaster waffles instead. the little things.","Good for you. I had a pretty minor drinking habit that I caught and acted on relatively quickly, and I still think about drinking more days than not despite it having been a while now. I'm always amazed at how powerful the sensation of craving can be, and can't imagine what people who've drank heavily for years and years must go through in quitting. Not drinking is one the better things I've done in my life, and the benefits seem to compound the longer you go. My brain seems to work considerably more efficiently, and I continue to feel and overwhelming sense of clarity that wasn't present when I drank. This is all despite still dealing with my mental illness bullshit; obviously things aren't great all the time, but they'd be a lot worse if I still drank a lot frequently.","This response seems to share a similar feeling of warmth from the responder. The responder shares a similar experience they had and how they handled it, connecting with the seeker. Since this can be a borderline weak empathy response, it is understandable the model struggled with this."
I don't want to be alone.. But I have to be.,How tragic and true. We of r/depression can be alone together.,"This response also shares similar feelings."
I don't think I have much time on this planet.. I just don't think I can make it much longer.,Well stop being that way jeez,"Not sure why the model classified this as weak empathy, there seems to be no empathy. It could be because jeez is not a well defined phrase so the model considers it to possibly share some sort of similar feeling with the seeker."
i keep pushing people away. how do i stop how do i bottle up my emotions so only my therapist can know things i dont want anyone else to know how i feel anymore how do i stop,"You stop by examining your negative habits that you have and changing them, and also committing to yourself to not push people away even when you want to. It's your natural response sure, but you really have to struggle to change that pattern. It's going to take resistance, and you have to have motivation to do it.","This response does not express much empathy. It is possible that the model learns words like 'motivation' and consider them as being empathetic."
someone please help me. Im scared of i dont know,lol same but how can you help that,"The seeker seems to express a lot of emotion here while the responder does not. This is clearly not an empathetic response but the model may consider the emotions of the seeker to be evoking an empathetic response and may lead the model to making such a prediction."
I sleep to run away from reality. I slept 16h yesterday. It was so good. I wish I could sleep forever.,"Me too! Sleep is awesome. Accept that you do what you enjoy, it just happens to be sleeping. Then stop feeling guilty. Channel what you enjoy. Start a dream journal. Medidate. Go camping and sleep in nature. Find a cuddle buddy or pet and sleep together. Enjoy your hobby!","This feels like an empathetic post. The annotation instructions state to mark allusions or expressions of warmth and similar feelings as weak empathy, and this response seems to evoke such reactions, so it makes sense why the model may predict this way."
i never thought i could kill myself but i feel like it will happen soon. i feel like i'm close to it happening .,"Well I dont know what to say, do you know why you feel that ? Is there any reason ? It could be a good start for discussion. It's your life, your story and when I thought hard about suicide, I told to myself that my story wont end like that, not yet at least.","I can see how the model struggles with this. There are aspects of empathy like asking why they feel that way which shows some concern, but the tone of how that is projected seems to lack some empathy. Something a human annotater can see but the model may lack the parameters for."
Am I the only one ?. Is anyone not going to school or work?,It can. It didn't work for me (only get worse) but maybe it will a good experience for you. I really hope ...,"This feels incomplete. But since the responder shares a similar experience, it can match the annotation of sharing a similar feeling with the seeker."
