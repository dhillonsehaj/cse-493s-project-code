I'm a fucking idiot.. Just a stupid pathetic fucking idiot.,What went so wrong that you think that?,"While the exploration does seem a bit generic, there isn't much information in the seeker post so the model may consider that the question is quite specific when there is a lack of information."
"I pushed away the last friend I had. I'm all alone now. Well, at least I saved him from seeing the true monster that I am.. Goodbye, Matt. I hope you do well in your life.",How did you manage that?,"While the exploration does seem a bit generic, there isn't much information in the seeker post so the model may consider that the question is quite specific when there is a lack of information."
"Okay, I'm going to do it. Today, I'm gonna ask for help.. Sorry in advance, Elliot. Everyone else, wish me luck :)","That's great OP, the first step in overcoming the depression and the shitty feelings is being ready to ask for help. Talking can be very helpful and sometimes it feels good to let your feelings out. How are you doing today?","While the exploration does seem a bit generic, there isn't much information in the seeker post so the model may consider that the question is quite specific when there is a lack of information. The responder seems to use a lot of positive reinforcement verbiage which can explain why the model perceived it as being a bit more specific when asking a question."
4am and I can't sleep again I wish I had a big hairy bearded man to cuddle me :(. Being lonely and old sucks.,Tell me about it. Good luck in your search!,"Not sure why this was predicted to be specific exploration, could be the shortness of the response."
"I dropped out. One semester short of a bachelors in math. Ended a year long relationship. Quit my job. not sorry for leaving, sorry I stayed so long.",I like your conviction. Sometimes cleaning the slate is what you need. What's next in the life master plan?,"Again, the short responses could cause the model to overperform on the predictio and emphasize the one question as more specific."
I’ve struggled with anxiety my entire adult life and haven’t been depressed since I was an early teen.. Now depressed and I have no idea to get out of this hole. I thought I had gotten past this and had completely forgotten the consuming feelings. I thought I was more equipped to deal...,You are more equipped to deal with it :) Youre like a marathon runner thats been a couch potato for the past ten years because you didnt have a reason to run... How are you feeling ?,"This response seems to provide more feedback to the seeker and ends with a simple question. The feedback may cause the model to think it is preparing a specific exploration when in reality it is unrelated."
"Plz help me... ... I'm tired of living, I just wanna die",Tell us a bit more. What's your story?,"Again, short response, could overperform on the exploration."
im depressed. can someone lift me up for a bit?,I can't make any promises :P But I'm up so I'll try to help. What's up?,"Again, short response, could overperform on the exploration. "
Guys it really hurts. I just want it to stop,"Can you open-up a bit to explain? What's the matter? Go on, if it's alright with you.","Again, short response, could overperform on the exploration. Even includes 'opening up' which exhibits more exploration."
Why. I'm drunk because I have nobody to get drunk with. It feels good that I can kind of get my mind off of things. I haven't been very happy lately. Isn't Christmas the happiest time of the year?,"Hey, what's up? In general, it is the happiest time of year, but on an individual level, happiness can be at any level, any time of year.","Again, short response, could overperform on the exploration."
