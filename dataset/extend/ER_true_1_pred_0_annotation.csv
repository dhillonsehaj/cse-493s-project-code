"Since I can't say it to anybody anymore. I love you, I hope you have a great day..",This hit me. I hope that I stay with my so and be able to say this to them everyday,"This response does not include many overtly emotional words. It mentions how the seekers post 'hits them' which can show that it impacts the responder, but the model may not pick up on this."
Iâ€™m 16 and trans. to the point if susicide help me,"Find a new one. I've had several therapists, and too many of them were just a really bad fit. Especially the last one, she was super nice but way, way not helpful to me. I'd blame myself too if sessions weren't good. There's some classic depression for ya. But I guess it's common knowledge to try different therapists until you get a good fit? I didn't know that for years so now I kinda overcompensate by telling everyone to shop around as needed. Good luck.","This response has some compassion to it which explains the weak empathy annotation. However, it is also a large block of text. It is possible that the response being mostly informational with a touch of wording which really exhibits compassion confuses the model and results in a no empathy prediction."
I want to give up.. So very badly. I've ruined everything good in my life. I can't take this pain anymore. I want it to stop. I want to be dead. This is too much. I can't undo my stupidity and now I'm fucked. I can't do this.,"I have been at a similar point to you where I had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest, even when aspects in my life have improved, I still struggle with it frequently. I have done many things in life I regret and feel like I've fucked up a lot of situations, relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life. It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are. I have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless I am. If you have someone you trust to talk to, please dont be afraid to rant or reach out to them. My inbox is always open too if you need a stranger to listen. You're not alone in this.","The vocabulary used in this response may have led to the model misclassifying. There is some profanity along with personal annecdotes that draw attention away from the seekers post and can be viewed less of empathy and more of sharing different information, which for profanity could even be aggressive, so the model may take the large block of text and not extract enough empathy from it to mark it as weak empathy."
"A broken soul. I think caring about someone, and they are your world and everything to you and then realising you are nothing to them hurts the most in the world. Then, when you get replaced so easily by someone else it feels like someone is stabbing you in the chest.","Yes. I'm going through this exact scenario right now. It's causing me to question my entire reality with him. It's such an earth shattering feeling. Like, what else can I not trust in my world? The worst part was that in my gut, I knew it. I've known it for longer than I've wanted to admit. I just hoped I was wrong and let myself get sucked in even further. I believed all the bullshit just because maybe he meant it when he told me he loved me. He didn't mean it. I can't comprehend doing that to someone I loved. So I totally understand how you feel. I'm here if you want to talk.","Not a lot of explicit language demonstrating empathy even though together the words seem to express empathy. The profanity can also draw away from it and cause the model to understand it as less empathetic."
Hey at least I make myself laugh. at a point where unable to react to a situation without making some kind of sarcastic joke or comment. Probably not a healthy way to think but at least I can find some entertainment in my life.,"Laughter is a hugely important way of dealing with life, in my opinion. Sometimes I also make myself laugh and realise life is not too bad afterall. Keep finding the funny edge to everything and you can cope with anything.","Not a lot of explicit verbiage that expresses empathy. There is some sharing of similar feelings but much of it can be considered informational which can lead the model to predict no empathy."
My depression affects others. I realized my depression makes those around me depressed too.,You know what that means? It means that you're an influence to others. People care about you and share the same feelings as you.,"This response does not have much empathy in it. It seems to be borderline empathetic which can explain why the model predicted wrong."
Need Someone to hold me. Feel like I have nothing left,I would hold the shit out of you,"This response does not have much empathy in it. It seems to be borderline empathetic which can explain why the model predicted wrong."
Finally decided to go out!. but all my friends decided not to go at the last minute.  fuck you guys.,"This post made me smile because of the grim feel, but then I felt super sorry and sad because I can relate too well..","This response does not have much empathy in it. It seems to be borderline empathetic which can explain why the model predicted wrong."
anyone else feel like they cant do anything?. I just feel like there's nothing that i'm good at. I want to be good at doing something but i have no skills when it comes to the things i wish i could do.,I feel the same way. unnerving to live in a world with so many talented people who do meaningful work and are achieving so much whereas I can do nothing but watch,"This response does not have much empathy in it. It seems to be borderline empathetic since it just relates to the seeker but does not express many other feelings which can explain why the model predicted wrong."
Sometimes I know that I am doing something that will make my depression worse but I just can't stop!. Over eating not making plans with friends ETC ETC,"Oh crap dude me too... I keep lying in bed all day and binge-eating junk food (like, an entire bag of hot cheetos and then more) and l always end up feeling even worse after but l can't stop.","This response does not have much empathy in it. It seems to be borderline empathetic since it just relates to the seeker but does not express many other feelings which can explain why the model predicted wrong."
