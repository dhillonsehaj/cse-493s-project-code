44lud8_czrgweq,"I beat depression. You can too.. Persevere, it is worth the fight.","Because depression isn't the same for everyone, so there is no 'one size fits all' cure for everyone. And some of the things you mentioned can be downright harmful for some people. For instance, tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge. There's a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar. Treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis. This sub is more of a support group, meant for encouraging each other to hang on, to keep fighting, and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help. I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar.
