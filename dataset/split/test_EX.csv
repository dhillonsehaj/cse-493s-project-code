I mean to say that those jobs are only limited to people with depression, just that a good fit Edit: Jobs like being an artist, working in the film industry, therapists, nurses, etc.","Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people.

Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood.  The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling.  Part of the reason I think you and I are on this subreddit in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively.

It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :)  If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort.  Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard.  In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality).  Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this subreddit. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'.  But don't cover that feeling up.

But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression.  I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way.  I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me.  But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood.  I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases.

Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect.  5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later.  Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me.  Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect.  St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon.  Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet.  Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home.  Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests.  ---  Lifestyle:  ---  Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though.  Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression.  Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world.

8us7n9_e1hski0,When does it get better?. I wasted the 'best years of my life' in highschool being depressed. Now I'm equally depressed in uni when I should be having even more fun partying and learning new things. What am I waiting for? Being even more depressed in an office job? It's too much..,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall.

I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes...  I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that.  I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me.  I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently.  I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart.  Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise.  In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture.  I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are.  My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important.  I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody.  My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most.  Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go.  After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all.  I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed.  I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud.  Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better.  I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling.  Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me.  It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one.  My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always.  I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.  TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy.

8e6t0k_dxsu7va,"Advice on how to date a depressed person?. I am in love with my boyfriend for him. Unfortunately, he has battled depression long before me. I love him, but loving him can be so hard. It hurts when he becomes distant when his emotions become overwhelming. It hurts when he becomes upset. I know he is going through an extremely tough mental battle, so I refrain from telling him my thoughts. I have got him to seek help (antidepressants). He has begun opening up to his friends and family. I am very happy for him! I am proud of how far he has progressed. He loves me a lot, and depends on me for his hapiness. It is difficult making him happy when his depression is taking a toll on me. I have sacrificed so much of my hapiness for him, and all in the name of love. Right now, he is spending time with his friends and BEING HAPPY while I am at home worrying about him and thinking of ways in which I can be a better girlfriend. I am choosing to prioritize his emotions over mine because he is a good person who deserves to happy. Any advice on dating a depressed person?","Dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums. I suggest you to focus on your own happiness first, then be there to support them when they need you. You are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals. Live and let live, support and be supported are the key. You are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldn't give more than what you must. It should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate. Otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return.

But until then, see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality, there is no such thing as or You define if it is. Try to find the postive part in your current situation. There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson.  For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is.  Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.

While also making your focus more on certain things. So, if you are angry and you drink, you might start to feel less angry. This because alcohol is making the problems go away, just becoming less conscious. The common thing that happens is we trick ourselves into thinking alcohol = less The reality is that there is less of anything. There is less pain, but there is less joy, jealousy, curiosity, on the spectrum of sobriety, stone sober is at one side and unconscious is on the other side.

But the problem lies in revisiting sobriety (which is why I call it an if The feelings return and feel stronger than before. This is often what promotes alcoholism. a perpetual escape from returning return of feeling.  This is not to demonize alcohol. Like I said, all about how used. Since, underage, I recommend it.
